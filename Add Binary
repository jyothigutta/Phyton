Given two binary strings (strings containing only 1s and 0s) return their sum (also as a binary string).
Note: neither binary string will contain leading 0s unless the string itself is 0
"""

a=input('Enter the first number: ')
a=input('Enter the second number: ')

sum = bin(int(a, 2) + int(b, 2))
  
# Printing result
print(sum[2:])
